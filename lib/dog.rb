#Line 4: Create a class variable `@@all` set to an empty array inside your class.
    #  This array is the storage container for each instance of a `Dog` that gets created. 
    # In other words, every puppy that is born should get pushed into this array at the moment of instantiation â€” in the `#initialize` method!

#Line 9: Use the `self` keyword inside the `#initialize` method to refer to the new dog you are trying to store in your `@@all` array.


#Line 12: Write a class method, `.all`, that returns the `@@all` variable.
    #From inside the `Dog` class, we can access the `@@all` class variable, but whenever we might be interacting with our `Dog` class from the outside, this `.all` class method acts as our direct interface to the `@@all` variable.

#Line 21: Write a class method, `.print_all`, that iterates over all of the individual dogs stored in the `@@all` array and `puts` out their name to the terminal.
